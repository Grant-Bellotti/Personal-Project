        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there! I'm Grant, a sophomore at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who is a passionate problem solver with an endless curiosity of computer science and the possibilities that come with it. 
        I love the intricate nature of coding and debugging, algorithms, data structures, and software development, and using them to create solutions to complex challenges.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My expertise extends across multiple programming languages, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can exchange ideas and learn from other technology enthusiasts. 
        Beyond computer science, I have a penchant for staying active, exploring nature, diving into the possibilities of upcoming technologies, and staying on top of the latest tech.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Join me on this expedition as I uncover and learn the infinite potential and opportunities that computer science has to offer. 
        Together, we'll explore new concepts and turn ideas into reality, one line of code at a time.
